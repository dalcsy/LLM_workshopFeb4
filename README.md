# LLM_workshopFeb4

In this project, we are hoping to create a tool for journal recommendation

We have two plans:

A. Feed reference abstracts in journals directly to GPT-4o mini and ask it to compare these with our abstract provided

B. Generate embeddings from [text-embedding-3-small](https://openai.com/index/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates/) and feed embeddings generated of the reference abstracts vs embeddings of our abstract provided into GPT-4o mini

and we'll compare results generated from both plans.
